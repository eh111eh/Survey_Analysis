# Survey_Analysis
 This project analyses survey responses on students' preferences between coursework and exam-based assessments. It applies Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis, keyword extraction, and topic modelling. The results are visualised through charts showing sentiment trends, assessment weight preferences, and reasons for supporting coursework or exams.
