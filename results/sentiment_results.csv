This is the reason I suspect why we are seeing lower exam results (See the feedback forms). As an example, the recent Dynamics and Vector Calculus exam had exceptionally poor results, and an entire section of the course (changing coordinate systems) did not even have a single question, instead the majority of marks being delegated to 3d integration questions. A large chunk of the dynamics course was also not examined for the same reason. This problem was made significantly worse by the fact we were not allowed a self-made sheet. As for why I do not believe coursework should be the majority of the grade, I am almost certain that the majority of students partially cheat these handins and quizzes. You would see insane grade inflation. It would also increase stress levels as every handin would be even more important. Most importantly, students would also feel cheated if they did very well in an exam of the same length as before but is instead weighted very little in such a new coursework dependent system.",3,Physics,in recent time exams course changed from able to choose questions to answer to now only given certain ones to reason suspect why seeing lower exam results see feedback forms example recent dynamics vector calculus exam exceptionally poor results entire section course changing coordinate systems not even single question instead majority marks delegated to 3d integration questions large chunk dynamics course also not examined same reason problem made significantly worse fact not allowed selfmade sheet why not believe coursework should majority grade almost certain majority students partially cheat handins quizzes would see insane grade inflation would also increase stress levels every handin would even more important most importantly students would also feel cheated very well in exam same length before instead weighted very little in such new coursework dependent system,[]

The coursework means throughout the semester you get feedback on exam style questions which is valuable; and I think a heavily weighted exam is the best way to test the knowledge. For courses more based on maths, such as MoMP and Fourier analysis and stats, more coursework would be better. This is as the maths takes longer to sink in, and a lot of people by exams aren't confident in answering the questions in the allotted time without making mistakes etc. But in their own time can answer them confidently and have understood the material. Maybe a 60(exam)/40 split or something similar would be a more fair way of assessing students in such courses. I still feel they should be weighted more towards exams as I believe they are the a good/best way of assessing someones understandings in both maths and physics.
