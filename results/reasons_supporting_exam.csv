7080 exam personal preference rest appropriate continous assessment
not massive fan 80 course relying on one exam believe not fair way assessing ones knowledge courses also relies on luck sometimes topic question might easier sometimes might really hard feel more continuous assessment throughout year would better measure peoples knowledge course
more heavily weighted coursework such in many school maths courses can often allow better understanding concepts throughout semester also stops grades ruined poor performance during 2 hour exam 2 questions not allow to fully demonstrate any knowledge may
took fluid mechanics course last semester 50 exam 50 coursework feel like best way to 80 exam just puts too much pressure on one day
suffer from significant anxiety around exams know leads to underperforming makes exams unpleasant frustrating process so personally i’d prefer to assessed on coursework however understand can significantly more challenging to motivate some learners without fear exam
sometimes exams not reflect teaching assessment style throughout year so heavily dependant on lecturer writing creates disadvantage when year several new lecturers over past 2 years narrows number topics can assessed topic aren’t great comes up on coursework time to work question ultimately understand more topic less sure comes up on exam not chance then overall grade incredibly negatively affected despite fact may deep understanding all other topics
exam to unreliable in standard working to put so much weight on item can punishing struggle on topic unlucky to high marks on exam bases off topic
best course in opinion regards to assessment ila in first year beauty courses assessment struck good balance think having 100 exam poor decision feels unfair whole semesters work judged off exam lasting 3 hours equally every course fully coursework then could really addup so say like in ila 3040 exam 6070 coursework mark fairest form assessment folly to think just course focusses on coursework throughout semester affords less valuable learning think learn better from course work than cramming exam coursework forces consistency exams encourage solely good memory
i’d prefer fair split 70 exam 30 coursework minimum 100 exam ridiculous
would definitely prefer more coursework especially coursework somehow related to exam questions would make students familiar how exam questions marked myself would also prefer pace coursework may tightly follow up lecture teaching pace
would say ideal split would 6040 in favour exam
during exam can get unlucky some content questions might overlooked when revising having more significant coursework weight would help regard
normally prefer exam however maths courses quite difficult more coursework takes pressure off
i’m good test taker so prefer exams think courses 100 exam diabolical only assessing student one way in day age feel extremely outdated don’t get choice
exams dont just add pressure to one day there all stress leading up to exam massively impact social life on top exam stress doesnt finish once sat paper to anxiously sit wait results over month
think courses best assessed even components say 50 coursework 50 exam like observational astronomy in 3rd year significant course work allows mind to say tuned focused semester without high stress any particular heavily weighted component any given time
think ideally best both worlds would exam thats weighted 100 then optional course thats mark so students wish to engage more content able to
would probably prefer 6040 exam coursework split potentially even 5050 split 7030 would ok 8020 always feels little hard
exam worry more than 80 would too stressful there added pressure
believe right balance would 6040 exam to coursework not much pressure on exam more chance to balance out grade throughout semester
single heavily weighted exam can greatly influenced how someone feels on day can quite burdensome i’d prefer having multiple exams spread throughout semester year significant coursework also sounds like good alternative
id say coursework will improve learning having more time wont really confirm understanding exam alone not enough to ensure understanding only test certain format wayand time pressure during exam can too much affect thinking
like exam think some coursework could improved more interesting things than weekly 4 question quiz example like thermal physics project in y3
like many maths courses 60 exam 40 coursework
6040 perfect split exam still worth more so need to still study gets rid lot stress
completely depends on exam prep required vs coursework workload in question feel like coursework based courses feel less stressful require much more wortk comparable grade in experience
think 100 exam not helpful 6080 exam good how much like coursework often varies widely depending on subject professor
feel like having more even split coursework exam reduces variance leads to more accurate measure students understanding when almost entire course mark depends on performance in just one day means random factors on day having headache minor illness poor sleep test anxiety out control student can large influence on overall mark in course furthermore having more emphasis on coursework means student continually assessed throughout semester compared to exams student could cram might increase their mark in exam not represent knowledge would carry over well in future
helpful to some coursework component helps prepare exam to give some confidence there limit to how much coursework student can reasonably programme needs to ensure students not overloaded coursework distributed evenly throughout semester
think 7570 exam 2530 coursework good balance
traditional exam based courses 100 not fully representative students understanding particularly in exams where time pressure significant factor slight slip up in early stage 25 mark question can completely derail rest question may deep understanding topic time pressure means significant portions marks also totally unachievable
would much prefer 80 to 90 exam than 100 exam
answered “heavily weighted exam” reflection there 40 pass component exams then increase coursework component takes time away from studying exam there not 40 requisite exam then coursework can focussed on entirely think coursework more representative real world during time can taken to think problem workload can managed exams more highly pressured more time should given
lean toward heavier weighted exam due to allowing more time to absorb knowledge throughout after semester appreciate courses handins throughout
heavily weighted 100 should only classes purely knowledge checks exam should not weighted 100 applications heavy course where problems can take many hours to
coursework reduces exam stress best pieces coursework projects interesting learn lot from
biased since im on pwya still think lecture courses could incorporate more coursework even multiple exams spread throughout semester mid term two could help reduce allornothing feel final exam
prefer 80 exam to significant coursework prefer significant coursework to 100 exam
exam gives too much pressure
so stressful around exam season trying to remember everything find know content throughout year second exam hall anxiety hits feel don’t perform best continuous assessment year would brilliant helping manage horrible anxiety
having too much emphasis on one final exam adds unnecessary stress one bad afternoon wipes out semester worth hard work personally id much prefer putting less weight on exam adding more continuous assessment throughout semester example maybe making handins more frequent increasing importance mid term test thanks
in recent time exams course changed from able to choose questions to answer to now only given certain ones to reason suspect why seeing lower exam results see feedback forms example recent dynamics vector calculus exam exceptionally poor results entire section course changing coordinate systems not even single question instead majority marks delegated to 3d integration questions large chunk dynamics course also not examined same reason problem made significantly worse fact not allowed selfmade sheet why not believe coursework should majority grade almost certain majority students partially cheat handins quizzes would see insane grade inflation would also increase stress levels every handin would even more important most importantly students would also feel cheated very well in exam same length before instead weighted very little in such new coursework dependent system
found courses on key physics topics such quantum thermal 80 exam works best coursework means throughout semester get feedback on exam style questions valuable think heavily weighted exam best way to test knowledge courses more based on maths such momp fourier analysis stats more coursework would better maths takes longer to sink in lot people exams arent confident in answering questions in allotted time without making mistakes etc in their own time can answer confidently understood material maybe 60exam40 split something similar would more fair way assessing students in such courses still feel should weighted more towards exams believe goodbest way assessing someones understandings in both maths physics
personally prefer exams would prefer smaller shorter chopped up ones in exam focus on more specific topics season rather than one big one
