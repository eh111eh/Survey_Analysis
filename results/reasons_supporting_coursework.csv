get coursework dont give us loads negligable marks thermal physics first term
learn much more from coursework there time to deeper extracurricular reading exams unnerve lot time perform very well in practice exams very poorly in real ones
feel coursework overall shows better example how throughout term not think should get rid exams stress on one day don’t feel ever good representation how one person overall so think coursework should weighted more both equally important
coursework allows more understanding in experience examination preparation tends to more learning standard techniques rote from notes coursework more new applications understanding
general coursework dependant modules taken tend to perform much better on feel largely due to fact in coursework assessment you’re graded on knowledge entirety course material examinations can only assess so much
more heavily weighted coursework such in many school maths courses can often allow better understanding concepts throughout semester also stops grades ruined poor performance during 2 hour exam 2 questions not allow to fully demonstrate any knowledge may
took fluid mechanics course last semester 50 exam 50 coursework feel like best way to 80 exam just puts too much pressure on one day
suffer from significant anxiety around exams know leads to underperforming makes exams unpleasant frustrating process so personally i’d prefer to assessed on coursework however understand can significantly more challenging to motivate some learners without fear exam
sometimes exams not reflect teaching assessment style throughout year so heavily dependant on lecturer writing creates disadvantage when year several new lecturers over past 2 years narrows number topics can assessed topic aren’t great comes up on coursework time to work question ultimately understand more topic less sure comes up on exam not chance then overall grade incredibly negatively affected despite fact may deep understanding all other topics
exams in theory mean more time learning throughout course i’ve found courses still lot coursework it’s just not worth large percentage
best course in opinion regards to assessment ila in first year beauty courses assessment struck good balance think having 100 exam poor decision feels unfair whole semesters work judged off exam lasting 3 hours equally every course fully coursework then could really addup so say like in ila 3040 exam 6070 coursework mark fairest form assessment folly to think just course focusses on coursework throughout semester affords less valuable learning think learn better from course work than cramming exam coursework forces consistency exams encourage solely good memory
i’d prefer fair split 70 exam 30 coursework minimum 100 exam ridiculous
feel like more regular coursework makes sure learn required each week whereas without coursework its harder to manage time cram before exams exams can affected bad day example sick cannot demonstrate know vs on good day
prefer larger coursework projects weighted more opposed to series small handins
would definitely prefer more coursework especially coursework somehow related to exam questions would make students familiar how exam questions marked myself would also prefer pace coursework may tightly follow up lecture teaching pace
coursework actually forces to engage perhaps own research like small project best imo
during exam can get unlucky some content questions might overlooked when revising having more significant coursework weight would help regard
normally prefer exam however maths courses quite difficult more coursework takes pressure off
weighed coursework both less anxietyinducing find incredibly stressful gives constant assessment on ongoing performance
often struggle to give full attention to coursework large quantity coursework would only make more difficult to maintain highest quality work continuously throughout whole semester
having frequent coursework better than just 1 two assignments
think courses best assessed even components say 50 coursework 50 exam like observational astronomy in 3rd year significant course work allows mind to say tuned focused semester without high stress any particular heavily weighted component any given time
think significant coursework component favour would ideally consist few large pieces coursework like handins reports rather than frequent smaller assessments
would probably prefer 6040 exam coursework split potentially even 5050 split 7030 would ok 8020 always feels little hard
believe right balance would 6040 exam to coursework not much pressure on exam more chance to balance out grade throughout semester
only coursework best
single heavily weighted exam can greatly influenced how someone feels on day can quite burdensome i’d prefer having multiple exams spread throughout semester year significant coursework also sounds like good alternative
id say coursework will improve learning having more time wont really confirm understanding exam alone not enough to ensure understanding only test certain format wayand time pressure during exam can too much affect thinking
coursework only assestement just means put in time not necessarily reflect actual knowledge exams self made synopsis best both worlds think also increasingly advanced ai sceptical people not cheating however much uni policies instruct not to in physics especially think coursework heavy subjects detrimental to level education worth degree coding independent research subjects make sense something like math physics there no easy way to test without stress stress should not religiously avoided want to make exams less stressful think would much better just to give self made synopsis more time than necessarily needed feel free to contact more feedback
coursework mean hand ins essays etc engagement in tutorials not quizzes quizzes aren’t fair method assement people use ai
like exam think some coursework could improved more interesting things than weekly 4 question quiz example like thermal physics project in y3
think balance most important thing year feels very much like coursework semester 1 exams semester 2 think would easier more equally weighted components
defenitely prefer exams small coursework contribution think 8020 great
like many maths courses 60 exam 40 coursework
handins maths physics exercises might even more useful sometimes to practice concepts you’ve learned also feel having to submit coursework force student to keep practicing every week instead maybe leaving certain course end semester he’s wanted to focus on others handins shouldn’t too long then though especially from jh onwards amount courses their difficulty increases considerably student might feel overwhelmed there’s too many problems in single handin to several
completely depends on exam prep required vs coursework workload in question feel like coursework based courses feel less stressful require much more wortk comparable grade in experience
coursework would appropriate difficulty considering amount time every courses coursework would take
coursework helps lot people learn more effectively than other forms hand in work shop steady pressure throughout semester ensures longer term gain than two weeks panic end year
think 100 exam not helpful 6080 exam good how much like coursework often varies widely depending on subject professor
feel like having more even split coursework exam reduces variance leads to more accurate measure students understanding when almost entire course mark depends on performance in just one day means random factors on day having headache minor illness poor sleep test anxiety out control student can large influence on overall mark in course furthermore having more emphasis on coursework means student continually assessed throughout semester compared to exams student could cram might increase their mark in exam not represent knowledge would carry over well in future
helpful to some coursework component helps prepare exam to give some confidence there limit to how much coursework student can reasonably programme needs to ensure students not overloaded coursework distributed evenly throughout semester
think 7570 exam 2530 coursework good balance
answered “heavily weighted exam” reflection there 40 pass component exams then increase coursework component takes time away from studying exam there not 40 requisite exam then coursework can focussed on entirely think coursework more representative real world during time can taken to think problem workload can managed exams more highly pressured more time should given
sometimes feel like there so much coursework during term time simply dont time to sit down read book on subject professors always tell us to read textbooks so many reports instance one cannot all
coursework reduces exam stress best pieces coursework projects interesting learn lot from
biased since im on pwya still think lecture courses could incorporate more coursework even multiple exams spread throughout semester mid term two could help reduce allornothing feel final exam
prefer 80 exam to significant coursework prefer significant coursework to 100 exam
believe courses who’s content now used in industry research in mainly computational way fourier analysis statistics example should heavier weighted coursework aspect
think 7030 split could good 30 coursework
think coursework allows to organise knowledge in head its great way to learn course lecturer requirements
give more time coursework make courses 5050 courseworkexams
think overemphasis on coursework can lead to too much focus on during semester can detract somewhat from learning gets harder to keep up lectures etc
constant coursework makes hard to schedule not everyone same energy levels resources each week exams allow more flexibility in managing resources illness other commitments etc also preferred old exams choice in questions means really focus down on parts content dont manage to cover others well then better opportunity to demonstrate understanding ultimately cant all both coursework 100 required questions make much more constant stress expense really learning course content
in recent time exams course changed from able to choose questions to answer to now only given certain ones to reason suspect why seeing lower exam results see feedback forms example recent dynamics vector calculus exam exceptionally poor results entire section course changing coordinate systems not even single question instead majority marks delegated to 3d integration questions large chunk dynamics course also not examined same reason problem made significantly worse fact not allowed selfmade sheet why not believe coursework should majority grade almost certain majority students partially cheat handins quizzes would see insane grade inflation would also increase stress levels every handin would even more important most importantly students would also feel cheated very well in exam same length before instead weighted very little in such new coursework dependent system
coursework works best when feedback available immediately experience course able to provide almost immediate surprisingly good feedback its online maths quizzes helped improve so much faster than alternative name fo course fundementals algebra calculus thats helpful all
found courses on key physics topics such quantum thermal 80 exam works best coursework means throughout semester get feedback on exam style questions valuable think heavily weighted exam best way to test knowledge courses more based on maths such momp fourier analysis stats more coursework would better maths takes longer to sink in lot people exams arent confident in answering questions in allotted time without making mistakes etc in their own time can answer confidently understood material maybe 60exam40 split something similar would more fair way assessing students in such courses still feel should weighted more towards exams believe goodbest way assessing someones understandings in both maths physics
would prefer something closer to 5050 split 40 coursework 60 exams however think risk having too much coursework there isn’t enough time in semester to complete coursework all modules to high standard
prefer exams contributing more heavily 80 like most course now contribution too much around 70 more reasonable however coursework contributing mostly assignments marked normally not very very strict curved also okay
